# 🚀 Project Sarv-Drishti: AI-Powered Battlefield Node

## 📌 Overview
Project **Sarv-Drishti** is an AI-powered **Intelligent Battlefield Support System** developed for the hackathon.  
It integrates real-time **threat classification, prediction, and soldier decision support** into a lightweight battlefield node device.

The system has two main parts:
1. **Drishti AI Engine** – Backend intelligence module for analyzing multi-sensor data (threat scoring, trajectory prediction, engagement strategies).
2. **Sahayak Battlefield Node** – A rugged, soldier-friendly interface that delivers actionable intelligence and real-time tactical insights.
